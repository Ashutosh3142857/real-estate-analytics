        ### How This Works
        
        This page uses web scraping techniques to gather real estate market information from various online sources.
        
        The process works as follows:
        1. When you search for a location, the system attempts to scrape information from several real estate websites
        2. The raw text content is extracted using the trafilatura library, which removes HTML and keeps the main content
        3. Key market insights such as prices, trends, and metrics are extracted using pattern matching
        4. The information is presented in a structured format for easy consumption
        
        ### Sources
        
        The system attempts to gather information from these sources:
        - National Association of Realtors (NAR)
        - Zillow Research
        - Realtor.com Research
        - CoreLogic Market Trends
        - Location-specific real estate portals
        
        ### Example Integration Code
        
        You can integrate this functionality into your own applications using our integration system:
        
        ```python
        # Import the web scraper module
        from utils.web_scraper import get_real_estate_market_info, extract_market_insights
        
        # Get market information for a location
        market_info = get_real_estate_market_info("New York")
        
        # Extract structured insights
        insights = extract_market_insights(market_info)
        
        # Use the insights in your application
        print(f"Median price: ${insights.get('median_price', 'N/A')}")
        print(f"Price change: {insights.get('price_change_pct', 'N/A')}%")
        ```
        
        See the full example in `examples/web_scraping_example.py`
